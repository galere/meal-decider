# meal-decider
A restaurant decision program

In order to spend less time deciding where to go Iâ€™d like a program that decides for us. All members of the team will want both food and drink so if a member of staff cannot eat anything, or no drinks are served that they like, the team will not visit the venue.

# Input
There are two JSON feeds, one of which is a list of the team members with what they do drink and do not eat, the other feed contains venues with the food and drink options for that venue.The person using the program needs to be able to enter which team members will be attending.

# Output
The output returns which places are safe to go to, and if applicable why the team should avoid the other places
